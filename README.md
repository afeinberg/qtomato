# Simple QT-based Pomodoro timer

## About

Needed a [Pomodoro http://pomodorotechnique.com/] timer for Linux. Since I couldn't easily find one and wanted to learn QT, I built one with a UI similar to [TomatoTimer http://tomato-timer.com/]. 

## Building

Re-generate Makefile by running qmake -o Makefile qtomato.pro

## TODO

* D-bus and/or sound-based notifications
* Persistent state: being able to add, remove, and work through a list of tasks.
